# Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Algorithms Repository! This repository contains a collection of algorithms and data structures that I implemented during my time as a student. These implementations are a part of my personal history and are important to me. Some of them were coded in brazilian portuguese. They showcase my journey in learning and mastering various algorithms and data structures.
